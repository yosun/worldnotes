## Splat and Treat

A kiroween project allowing the user to choose a splat 3D world and then choose treats (3D objects) to place in them! Ecommerce Stripe payments is built in to make this scalable and feasible for Gen AI.

Use https://github.com/sparkjsdev/spark

Splat World: enable SparkJS splat colliders so that we can raycast hit to place Treats

Treats:

0. message in a bottle.
1. AI3D generated from user input (cost 5 tokens)
2. existing glbs searchable from our database

Skeleton Crew: Build a skeleton code template lean enough to be clear but flexible enough to support various use cases. Show us its versatility with two distinct applications from your foundation.

IMPORTANT

Keep this codebase elegant and clean, so that a human might be able to edit it easily and intuitively. The key thing is that this is effectively 3D skeletal code template combining both .spz and .glb that can be used for many different use cases.
