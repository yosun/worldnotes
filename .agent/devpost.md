#### 🎃 **Welcome to Kiroween** 👻

This Halloween, we’re kicking off our first-ever Kiroween hackathon. Experience how Kiro, our AI-powered IDE, can help you build out your spookiest, most creative, monstrous ideas. Whether you’re bringing dead tech back to life, stitching together something unexpected, or creating a UI that will give your users nightmares, Kiro will partner with you every step of the way. From brainstorming in natural conversation to building robust, spec-driven systems, Kiro handles the heavy lifting so you can focus on the magic.

For the love of building, or maybe the love of darkness, come craft something wicked and show us how you use Kiro’s features to push boundaries: vibe code in chat, add structure with specs, customize workflows with hooks or steering, or bring in new capabilities with MCP. Your creation will be judged on its potential value, implementation of Kiro, and creativity.

This is your moment to create something unforgettable. Get inspired by Kiroween’s special spooky factor, summon your ideas, and git commit to the darkness.

### Requirements

#### What to Build

Entrants must build a working software application that uses [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/) (vibe coding, agent hooks, steering docs, MCP, or specs) and submit it into one of the following categories:

##### Categories:

- **Resurrection:** Bring your favorite dead technology back to life. Reimagine obsolete tech with today’s innovations or solving tomorrow's problems.
- **Frankenstein:** Stitch together a chimera of technologies into one app. Bring together seemingly incompatible elements to build something unexpectedly powerful.
- **Skeleton Crew:** Build a skeleton code template lean enough to be clear but flexible enough to support various use cases. Show us its versatility with two distinct applications from your foundation.
- **Costume Contest:** Build any app but show us a haunting user interface that’s polished and unforgettable. Bring in spooky design elements that enhance your app’s function.

#### What to Submit

- Provide a URL to your open source code repository for judging and testing.

- The code repository must be public with an approved [OSI Open Source License](https://opensource.org/licenses)
- Your repo **must contain the /.kiro directory at the root of the project** to show usage of specs, hooks, and steering. Do NOT add the /.kiro directory or sub-folders to your .gitignore, as this could disqualify your submission.
- **For Skeleton Crew projects only:** Your repo must contain 2 separate repo folders for the 2 separate applications.

- Provide a URL to your functional application(s)

- You can provide login credentials in public code repo

- Include a three (3) minute demonstration video of your submission. Videos must be uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo, or Facebook Video and made public and judges are not required to watch beyond 3 minutes.
- Identify which category and bonus category you are submitting into.
- Provide a write up on how Kiro was used. Judges must understand how effectively you used Kiro to develop your project. Show us your next-level understanding of Kiro features, e.g.:

- **Vibe coding:** How did you structure your conversations with Kiro to build your project? What was the most impressive code generation Kiro helped you with?
- **Agent hooks:** What specific workflows did you automate with Kiro hooks? How did these hooks improve your development process?
- **Spec-driven development:** How did you structure your spec for Kiro to implement? How did the spec-driven approach improve your development process? How did this compare to vibe coding?
- **Steering docs:** How did you leverage steering to improve Kiro’s responses? Was there a particular strategy that made the biggest difference?
- **MCP:** How did extending Kiro’s capabilities help you build your project? What sort of features or workflow improvements did MCP enable that otherwise would have been difficult or impossible?

Please check the [Official Rules](https://kiroween.devpost.com/rules) for full details.
